# Review

In this lesson, you have successfully built a tree data structure in JavaScript. You have implemented:

* a TreeNode class that contains data and maintains a collection of TreeNode classes called children.

* an .addChild() method that adds a child to the tree as either data or TreeNode

* a .removeChild() method that removes a child from the tree as either data or TreeNode

* a .depthFirstTraversal() recursive method that fully traverses the tree with a top-down approach for each child of the tree

* a .breadthFirstTraversal() iterative method that fully traverses the tree a level at a time, instead of a child at a time
