## The Error Module

The Node environment’s error module has all the standard JavaScript errors such as EvalError, SyntaxError, RangeError, ReferenceError, TypeError, and URIError as well as the JavaScript Error class for creating new error instances. Within our own code, we can generate errors and throw them, and, with synchronous code in Node, we can use error handling techniques such as try...catch statements. Note that the error module is within the global scope—there is no need to import the module with the require() statement.

Many asynchronous Node APIs use error-first callback functions—callback functions which have an error as the first expected argument and the data as the second argument. If the asynchronous task results in an error, it will be passed in as the first argument to the callback function. If no error was thrown, the first argument will be undefined.

const errorFirstCallback = (err, data)  => {
  if (err) {
    console.log(`There WAS an error: ${err}`);
  } else {
    // err was falsy
    console.log(`There was NO error. Event data: ${data}`);
  }
}

## The Buffer Module

In Node.js, the Buffer module is used to handle binary data. The Buffer module is within the global scope, which means that Buffer objects can be accessed anywhere in the environment without importing the module with require().

A Buffer object represents a fixed amount of memory that can’t be resized. Buffer objects are similar to an array of integers where each element in the array represents a byte of data. The buffer object will have a range of integers from 0 to 255 inclusive.

The Buffer module provides a variety of methods to handle the binary data such as .alloc(), .toString(), .from(), and .concat().

The .alloc() method creates a new Buffer object with the size specified as the first parameter. .alloc() accepts three arguments:

Size: Required. The size of the buffer
Fill: Optional. A value to fill the buffer with. Default is 0.
Encoding: Optional. Default is UTF-8.
const buffer = Buffer.alloc(5);
console.log(buffer); // Ouput: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
The .toString() method translates the Buffer object into a human-readable string. It accepts three optional arguments:

Encoding: Default is UTF-8.
Start: The byte offset to begin translating in the Buffer object. Default is 0.
End: The byte offset to end translating in the Buffer object. Default is the length of the buffer. The start and end of the buffer are similar to the start and end of an array, where the first element is 0 and increments upwards.
const buffer = Buffer.alloc(5, 'a');
console.log(buffer.toString()); // Output: aaaaa
The .from() method is provided to create a new Buffer object from the specified string, array, or buffer. The method accepts two arguments:

Object: Required. An object to fill the buffer with.
Encoding: Optional. Default is UTF-8.
const buffer = Buffer.from('hello');
console.log(buffer); // Output: [104, 101, 108, 108, 111]
The .concat() method joins all buffer objects passed in an array into one Buffer object. .concat() comes in handy because a Buffer object can’t be resized. This method accepts two arguments:

Array: Required. An array containing Buffer objects.
Length: Optional. Specifies the length of the concatenated buffer.
const buffer1 = Buffer.from('hello'); // Output: [104, 101, 108, 108, 111]
const buffer2 = Buffer.from('world'); // Output:[119, 111, 114, 108, 100]
const array = [buffer1, buffer2];
const bufferConcat = Buffer.concat(array);

console.log(bufferConcat); // Output: [104, 101, 108, 108, 111, 119, 111, 114, 108, 100]

## The FS Module

All of the data on a computer is organized and accessed through a filesystem. When running JavaScript code on a browser, it’s important for a script to have only limited access to a user’s filesystem. This technique of isolating some applications from others is known as sandboxing. Sandboxing protects users from malicious programs and invasions of privacy.

In the back-end, however, less restricted interaction with the filesystem is essential. The Node fs core module is an API for interacting with the file system. It was modeled after the POSIX standard for interacting with the filesystem.

Each method available through the fs module has a synchronous version and an asynchronous version. One method available on the fs core module is the .readFile() method which reads data from a provided file:

const fs = require('fs');

let readDataCallback = (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.log(`Something went wrong: ${err}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Provided file contained: ${data}`);
  }
};

fs.readFile('./file.txt', 'utf-8', readDataCallback);
Let’s walk through the example above:

We required in the fs core module.
We define an error-first callback function which expects an error to be passed as the first argument and data as the second. If the error is present, the function will print Something went wrong: ${err}, otherwise, it will print Provided file contained: ${data}.
We invoked the .readFile() method with three arguments:
The first argument is a string that contains a path to the file file.txt.
The second argument is a string specifying the file’s character encoding (usually ‘utf-8’ for text files).
The third argument is the callback function to be invoked when the asynchronous task of reading from the file system is complete. Node will pass the contents of file.txt into the provided callback as its second argument.
